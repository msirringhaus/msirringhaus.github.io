This is me...or is it?

This is a place where I collect random thoughts and stories that happen during my working hours.

### The name

The name `traitshifter` is a conglomerate of references to what I do.

A trait is a [Rust thing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html), the language I currently mostly use.
I work for SUSE, with the lovely mascot [geeko](https://en.opensuse.org/User:Geeko), which is a chameleon. Not so much a shapeshifter, as a colorshifter, but you get the idea.
And finally, the idea of this blog is to wear a different persona for each article.
